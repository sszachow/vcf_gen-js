# JS vCard files generator
Simple js app for creating vcf files.

It uses cool libraries written by other people:
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)
* [Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js)
* and of course [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

TODO:
* add slider for percentage of pictures
* think about smarter photos implementation (iCloud fails if using embedded PNG; Gmail doesn't accept vcfs with photos as URLs; use local library for creating images)
* host app as a github page
