# JS vCard files generator
Simple js app for creating vcf files.

It uses cool libraries written by other people:
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) (v2.0.2)
* and of course [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (v3.5.0)

TODO:
* add slider for percentage of pictures
* think about smarter photos implementation (iCloud fails if using embedded PNG; Gmail doesn't accept vcfs with photos as URLs; use local library for creating images)
* host app as a github page
