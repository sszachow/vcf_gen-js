# JS vCard files generator
Simple js app for creating vcf files.

TODO:
* add license
* add slider for percentage of pictures
* write nice color gen class in gen_photos.py
* think about smarter photos implementation (iCloud fails if using embedded PNG; Gmail doesn't accept vcfs with photos as URLs; use local library for creating images)
